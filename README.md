software library that provides a set of tools for editing videos programmatically. Some of the features offered by YiVideoEditor include:

Rotating videos: This feature allows you to rotate a video clip by a certain angle. For example, if you have a video that was recorded in portrait mode, you can use YiVideoEditor to rotate it so that it can be viewed in landscape mode.

Cropping videos: This feature allows you to crop a video clip by selecting a specific portion of the video frame. For example, if you have a video that has some unwanted elements in the frame, you can use YiVideoEditor to crop those elements out.

Adding layers (watermark): This feature allows you to add a layer of text or an image (watermark) to the video. For example, if you want to add your company logo to a video, you can use YiVideoEditor to overlay the logo on top of the video.

Adding audio (music) to videos: This feature allows you to add audio tracks to the video. For example, if you want to add a background music track to a video, you can use YiVideoEditor to add the audio track to the video.
